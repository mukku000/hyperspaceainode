# hyperspaceainode


This repository provides a script to easily set up a Hyperspace AI node.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure you have `screen` installed. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y screen`. On CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install screen -y`
* ... any other prerequisites

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/mukku000/hyperspaceainode.git)

 * Navigate to the directory:
   cd hyperspaceainode

 * Run the setup script:
   ./deploy.sh

Private Key Security (CRITICAL)
This script will generate a new private key for your node locally. This key will be stored in [explain where it's stored - e.g., a file named private_key.txt in the current directory]. It is absolutely essential that you keep this key secure. Do not share it with anyone. If you lose this key, you will lose access to your node and any associated funds.
